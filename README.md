## FaceHuggerV2 has been debugged and released. As per the original FaceHugger code, you will need a clearview AI API key obtained from the official sources. 
V2 brings functionality to choose from a few mainstream security camera brands, and then connect to the chosen camera with the appropriate credentials added in your local version of FaceHuggerV2.py. V2 then provides social media accounts of those found within the footage live real time or as a standard jpeg file. When the social media profiles are found, a browser is then opened and the content is displayed.
